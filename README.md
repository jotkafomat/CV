## Krzysztof Jankowski

I am a recent graduate of intense 16-week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy looking to join a software development team, where I could apply everything I have learned so far and grow as a developer.

When I was furloughed in March 2020 I started learning iOS development, which culminated with a one month placement at Farmdrop in July. In September, I started the bootcamp at Makers, where I learned fundamentals of software development and industry’s best practices.

I love the excitement of solving problems in code. I am fascinated by how easy it is to write software once you have divided the problem into manageable chunks and when you follow Test Driven Development.
I also like the fact that rapid changes in the industry mean that there will always be something new to learn.

## Skills
### Speed of Learning / Commitment to learning

From the start of the first lockdown I was fully dedicated to learning iOS development and I have completed numerous online tutorials and courses including: Ray Wenderlich SwiftUI path, 100 days of Hacking with SwiftUI, DesignCode SwiftUI Course and Swift Playgrounds. After doing all of this in only 4 month I was offered a placement at Farmdrop, where I implemented a few screens in the iOS app using SwiftUI. They are currently used in the app. This determination to gain new knowledge and self-motivation helped me thrive during the intensive bootcamp at Makers. I was able to absorb new concepts very quickly.

### Team work / Working with Others:

Before I started learning to code I was a chef at Rex Whistler. It is a restaurant with two Rosettes in the prestigious AA Guide.  Delivering such level of excellence requires close collaboration and  effective communication between kitchen members. These skills are even more important when working under time pressure. To make the kitchen run smoothly each chef needs to know what others do, be responsible not only for their work but also make sure that no team member is left behind. I’ve found that the same principles apply to pair programming and team projects that I did extensively during my time at Makers. I’ve found that open communication, active listening, showing respect, recognising others’ contributions and safe environment help create better code and better product. Influencing and valuing other members of your team enable achieving bigger goals.

### Analytical Reasoning:

My sociology degree and my experience as freelance researcher thought me how to deduce logical output from numerous components: conducted interviews, focus groups and existing literature to deliver conclusions in a meaningful report. I found that these skill are very useful when looking for solutions when writing code: breaking problems into smaller parts and looking for patterns.

### Preparing & Prioritising:

Both research and work in kitchen meant that I had to be organised and manage my time very well to deliver consistently high quality product. I used to start every day in the kitchen with a detailed plan. Prioritising work items considering short term goals (such as the next lunch service) and having in mind the bigger picture. Making sure that I had time to do things I needed to do daily and keeping ahead with dishes that need more time to prepare. I used the same technique when planning my days during the bootcamp. I used a Trello board to plan my tasks, and track my progress, which gave me confidence that I was on track with my learning. I also set up similar boards for team projects where we could write tickets, prioritise them and estimate difficulty and time needed to deliver them.
