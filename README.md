## Krzysztof Jankowski

I have MA in Sociology but last seven years I’ve worked as a chef. When my restaurant was closed in March 2020 I decided that I need a job I can do remotely. I started learning to code. Since September 2020, I have been studying at Makers Academy, a developer bootcamp, where I have been learning fundamentals of software development. During that time I created with my team project A. I’m fascinated by how programming languages become more accessible and how close they could be to the normal language.

Combining this with my passion for what I do, I ensured that food was provided with high standard. Rex Whistler Restaurant had two Rosette in prestigious AA Guide.

I was also eager to learn from more experience colleagues.
